/**
* Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
* you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits
* in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
* 
* You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick
* one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
* 
* Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
* 
* Example 1:
* 
* Input: Fruit = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
* Output: 3
* Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
